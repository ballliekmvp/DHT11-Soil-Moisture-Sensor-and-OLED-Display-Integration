# DHT11-Soil-Moisture-Sensor-and-OLED-Display-Integration
This project shows how to interface a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, a soil moisture sensor, and an SSD1306 OLED display with an Arduino. It reads data from the sensors and displays temperature, humidity, and soil moisture percentage (0-100%) on the OLED screen.
